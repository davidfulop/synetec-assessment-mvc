## SynetecMvcAssessment.AcceptanceTests

### Setup
Place a chromedriver.exe in the project's root directory to run the tests on Chrome.

### Notes
The tests are tied to the data that is present in the initial database script. (i. e. if the data is changed, tests might fail.)


## SynetecMvcAssessment

### Notes
I did not commit the change to the `web.config`, as only the connection string has changed. (And it contains sensitive data.)
